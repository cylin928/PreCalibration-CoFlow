    "## B.8.1 Why Pre-Calibration?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jumping into \"how\" to do the pre-calibration, let's start by answering \"why\" we may need this technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-calibration is a pragmatic, flexible, and low-cost alternative, especially in the following situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models are computationally expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model take a long time to run, even for just a minute, the computational cost may not be feasible for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or full Bayesian inference as the number of model evaluations (in the scale of tens of thousands to millions) in those more formal uncertainty quantification techniques is much higher than what pre-calibration is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Full probabilistic treatment is unjustified or infeasible\n",
    "\n",
    "Many complex simulation models, especially those involving human decision-making or agent-based behaviors, lack an explicit or tractable likelihood function. This makes it difficult or impossible to formally apply Bayesian inference methods, which rely on the likelihood to update prior beliefs. For example, agent-based models may include discrete, rule-based decisions and path dependencies that don’t lend themselves to a mathematically smooth or differentiable likelihood surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem space is large and uncertain\n",
    "\n",
    "Many models are structurally complex and include numerous parameters, often with limited observational data to constrain them, which is often the case for human-water systems modeling. A full probabilistic approach would require defining priors and exploring joint distributions over potentially under-informed parameters, which could lead to unidentifiable or non-informative posteriors. The equifinality phenonminon, where multiple model configurations result in similar outcomes, add another layer of complexity and difficulty in uncertainty quantification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision-makers may require rapid insights\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, decision-makers may require rapid insights or robustness testing over a range of plausible futures, rather than full posterior distributions. Pre-calibration offers a practical compromise that it helps filter implausible parameter sets based on observed behavior, enabling focused exploration while avoiding overcommitment to unjustified assumptions."

    "\n",
    "Moving toward the \"how\" question, we want to learn how the conventional parameterization works for constructing a coupled human-water model then gradually look into what pre-calibration strategies we could use to reveal the uncertainty of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the complexity of coupled human-water model, often time a single best model configuration is picked from the component-wise model calibration. The uncertainty of this type of the model is then solely built from its stochatic nature in the model design. From the model configuration perspective, this can be view as a deteministic best model which ignore the uncertainty that could be brought by parameter uncertainty.\n",

    "\n",
    "Assuming we have a coupled model consists of a semi-distributed hydrological model and an agent-based model (ABM) where each agent may interact with different subbasins as well as other agent. Now, we could calibrate the hydrological model and ABM seperately using the available data. Suppose we pick a hydrological model that performed the best on a choosen error metric at the basin outlet and coupled with an ABM to evaluate a water conservation policy, what we ignore is the potential equifinal parameter configurations. Those equifinal hydrological models may have similar performance at the outlet but may vary in their subbasin-level hydrological responses. Remembering that agents are interacting with subbasins, the policy evaluation results derive from the coupled model simulation in this case may have significant uncertainty. \n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of using single best model configuration, this tutorial will walk you through how to reveal the parameter uncertainty through pre-calibration technique. Specifically, we want to compare two pre-calibration strategies: one is to conduct a component-wise pre-calibration the other is pre-calibration over a coupled model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If both stratgies achieve similar uncertainty information, component-wise pre-calibration maybe a more computationally efficienct workflow given a parameter sampling space is smaller compared to the full coupled model.\n",
